Title: Vim-Sweep

This is a Vim inspired Minesweeper game.  The basis is pretty much the same.
The only catch is that the buttons to move around are inspired by Vim, along
with some shortcuts to move around.  I am probably going to add more to this
game eventually and make it smoother all around.  Overall, it works and I spent
a lot of time on it.  I agree that the code needs to be cleaned up more, but
it's fully functional for now.

Use:
-- Call "make" to compile all of the files.
-- ./minesweep to run.
-- Enter your difficulty level by typing 1 (easy - 10 bombs), 2 (medium - 15
bombs), or 3 (hard - 20 bombs).
-- Admire the beautiful ASCII Vim art.
-- Press P to play.

Controls: 
-- Move around by pressing h (left), j (down), k (up), l (left).
-- 'gg' to go to the top of the screen.
-- 'G' to go to the bottom of the screen.
-- '0' to move to the beginning of a line.
-- '$' to move to the end of a line.
-- To sweep for mines, press 'i'
-- To mark a bomb, press 'm'.
-- To cheat, and see where the mines are located as well as numbers surrounding
them, press 'n'
-- The numbers around the mines tell you how many mines are adjacent to that
block.
-- type ':" followed by either 'w' (to mark that you've won, and have
successfully marked all of the bombs without touching them), or 'q' (to signify
you have quit). 

Other:
-- If you press 'i' (to sweep for a mine) and you are on-top of a mine, you will
lose the game.  
-- You are not able to go past the border (the 16th line).
